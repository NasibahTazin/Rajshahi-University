            <h1>Need</h1>
            <p>The need for a university in northern East Pakistan was evident after the country's creation, as the University of Dhaka was not easily accessible. Rajshahi was chosen for its establishment, and the Rajshahi University Act 1953 was passed. The university began academic activities in 1954 and moved to its current campus in 1961.</p>

            <h1>Departments</h1>
            <p>The university’s 59 departments are organized into twelve faculties. It has six institutes, of which two (IBA and IER) have undergrad and postgraduate programs. The University of Rajshahi is considered as one of the top research universities in Bangladesh. Recently, researchers from this university have made substantial contributions and played a key role in bringing back the ancient Bangladeshi Muslin fiber. The researchers of this university have also created the country’s first and only “snake database”, including snakes’ venom and their toxicity. The university has a strong alumni community around Bangladesh and abroad.</p>
